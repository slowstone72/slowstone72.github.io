					<h1>Exploring Public Pianos Online: Top 4 Multiplayer Piano Websites</h1>
					<section>
						<p>
							Ever wondered what it's like sharing a piano with 20+ other people across the world? (Yes, you <i>can</i> do that.)
							You may be surprised just how many websites offer a way to play the piano online with other.
							Given that there are so many platforms offering this today, I wanted to go on a journey of trying out some of the internet's public pianos.
							In this article, I'll compare the strengths and weaknesses of each platform to see which one takes the cake.
						</p>
						<p>So, let's get started at number four...</p>

						<p>
							Could there really be a better multiplayer piano than Multiplayer Piano itself? 
							Let's delve into the pros and cons of this old-timer.
							Multiplayer Piano has been around since 2012 - before many of its peers - and has changed quite a bit over the years.
							Initially, it simply offered a piano you can share with other users,
							but now it offers multiple user-created "rooms", a chat box, synthesizer effects, an MP3 recorder and a handful of other nifty features.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite its persistent evolution over the years, this piano website has had its fair share of persistent issues,
							largely related to bots - automated programs playing music and using the chat box -  
							and these days it's largely rejected by many of its former loyal users.
						</p>
						<p>But how does it compare with its competition today?</p>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Supports Various Inputs</b> - Can connect your MIDI-capable piano. Can use your computer mouse & keyboard.</li>
							<li><b>User Control</b> - Can mute other users who might annoy you.</li>
							<li><b>Custom Rooms</b> - Can create & share your own <i>private rooms</i> with others.</li>
							<li><b>Community Blog</b> - Has an attached blog for users interesting in reading about piano - Although, I've noticed a suspicious amount of gambling-related imagery, alongside references to features that don't actually appear to exist on the website - which may detract from the overall experience for some users.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Dated Feel</b> - Can be perceived as outdated compared to other websites.</li>
							<li><b>Broken Features</b> - Broken profile/nickname feature - The website used to save your profile, but doesn't anymore. This enables spammers to rejoin as a new user, even after you mute or kickban them.</li>
							<li><b>Unmoderated</b> - It can be difficult to contact somebody who can resolve issues on the website. Absence of moderation often invites trouble in the main lobby (E.G. repeated inappropriate messages, flooding the chat box, rapid piercing high-pitched notes)</li>
							<li><b>Questionable Censorship</b> - Messages that talk about other piano websites are edited automatically.

							</li>
							<li><b>Questionable Ad Placement</b> - Advertisements can overlay some user nicknames on smaller screens.</li>
							<li><b>Vulnerable to Attacks</b> - Vulnerable to spam attacks from bots that have the ability to repeatedly crash the website. Sometimes, this can even lag your browser and make the website unuseable.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							So, this long-standing piano website might be considered a mixed bag when compared to its peers,
							but is certainly capable of providing a good experience - provided the bots don't strike during your visit.
							Let's see how our next online piano compares...

							</a>
							<figcaption>Multiplayer Piano (dot) net on the 18th of January 2025</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Multiplayer Piano (dot) net is a community-ran version of Multiplayer Piano (dot) com. It became more popular with long-time users of the original after it was <a href="../multiplayer-piano/index.html#history">sold to somebody else</a>.</p>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Supports Various Inputs</b> - Can connect your MIDI-capable piano. Can use your computer mouse & keyboard. Can use Virtual Piano's computer keyboad layout.</li>
							<li><b>User Control</b> - Can mute other users if you wish.</li>
							<li><b>Custom Rooms</b> - Can create & share your own <i>private rooms</i> with others.</li>
							<li><b>Is moderated</b> - Users can use a "ticket" system on the website's Discord server to report bad behaviour as per the website's rules.</li>
							<li><b>Accounts</b> - Can login with your <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> account, so your profile can stay the same even on different networks.</li>
							<li><b>Clear Bot Policies</b> - Unauthorized bots are banned automatically, preventing bot spam. Authorized bots are labelled. Users can choose to hide all bots.</li>
							<li><b>Community</b> - Has an attached community forum, Reddit page and Discord server.</li>
							<li><b>Private Messages</b> - Can privately message other users.</li>
							<li><b>More Options</b> - Has more sound options than Multiplayer Piano (dot) com, a more customizable chat (can be hidden, configured to display message timestamps, etc.), and many more quality of life updates. You can toggle key labels.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Dated Feel</b> - Can be seen as outdated compared to other websites.</li>
							<li>Pianists may feel that the website is more bot-focussed.</li>
							<li>Many custom "rooms" are hosted by bots instead of users.</li>
						</ul>
						<a class="button background" role="button" target="_blank" href="https://multiplayerpiano.net/">Play Multiplayer Piano (.net)</a>
						<p>Overall, this community effort is certainly an improvement on the original, and is a testament to the power of a strong and dedicated community.</p>

							<figcaption>PianoRhythm on the 19th of January 2025</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>This one is somewhat of a website/desktop app hybrid, as it also offers downloads for an installer to run directly on your computer.</p>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Supports Various Inputs</b> - Can connect your MIDI-capable piano. Can use your computer mouse & keyboard.</li>
							<li><b>User Control</b> - Can mute other users if you wish.</li>
							<li><b>Custom Rooms</b> - Can create & share your own <i>private rooms</i> with others. You can even set passwords on your rooms.</li>
							<li><b>Is moderated</b> - Users can report trouble-makers within the website.</li>
							<li><b>Feature-rich</b> - More than just an online piano, it's clear that a lot of work has been done to make this a polished and versatile experience. You can register for an account or join as a guest. Once you're logged in, you can even save other users to a friends list. You even can resize and reposition the chat window, or hide it entirely.</li>
							<li><b>Supports Multiple Synths & Instruments</b> - Users can choose to use other piano or synthesizer sounds, or even drums for others to hear.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Complicated</b> - Can be seen as too visually or functionally complicated by some users.</li>
							<li><b>Tough on Lower-power Machines</b> - By default, the website uses a 3D view of a grand piano, but this can be switched to a 2D view and tweaked within the sites settings. It's generally heavier on low-end machines than some of the other options mentioned here, and can take a fair while to load in comparison.</li>

							<figcaption>Pianoverse on the 19th of January 2025</figcaption>

						<p>To me, Pianoverse strikes a balance between simplicity and offering all the features you might expect. This makes it a perfect choice for number one in this countdown.</p>
						<h3>Pros:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Supports Various Inputs</b> - Can connect your MIDI-capable piano. Can use your computer mouse & keyboard. Supports keyboard layouts from other websites like Multiplayer Piano and Virtual Piano.</li>
							<li><b>User Control</b> - Can mute other users if you wish.</li>
							<li><b>Custom Rooms</b> - Can create & share your own <i>private rooms</i> with others.</li>
							<li><b>Is moderated</b> - Users can report trouble to moderators within the website and on a Discord server.</li>
							<li><b>Supports Multiple Sounds</b> - Users can change the sound that piano makes.</li>
							<li><b>User Interface</b> - The visual design is clean, modern and uncluttered.</li>
							<li><b>Community</b> - Has official Discord and Reddit pages.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Cons:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Doesn't save user mutes</b> - While you can mute other users if you wish, this is undone if you rejoin the page.</li>
							<li><b>Doesn't support accounts.</b></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Overall, Pianoverse offers a sleak and easy way to share a piano online with others. Its primary focus is on the piano while simultaneously highlighting that users can chat with each other.</p>
