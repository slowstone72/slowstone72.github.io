						<h2><small>1. </small>Overview</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Multiplayer Piano</b> (or MPP) is a website that allows users to share a piano with other users from across the world. It was published by its creator Brandon Lockaby as a Google Chrome Experiment in 2012. Users can communicate through a text chat box, record their performances, and create and browse different rooms.
						</p>
						<p>
							The website offers numerous ways to interact with the piano using a standard PC keyboard and mouse. For example, velocity of notes can be controlled by lowering and raising your cursor's position on the page. You'll also find that pressing Backspace on your keyboard will toggle a lengthy note sustain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Arguably, the most attractive feature offered to pianists is the ability to connect your own piano to the website - provided it's MIDI capable, something offered by most piano keyboards today.
						</p>
						<p>
							Multiplayer Piano is described as "An online piano you can play alone or with others in real-time. MIDI support, 88 keys, velocity sensitive. You can show off your skill or chat while listening to others play."

							<h2>History</h2>
							<h3>Creation and Development</h3>
							<p>
								After publishing Multiplayer Piano in 2012, Lockaby implemented a whole skew of new features to the website: A text chat box, a synthesizer, the ability to record performances in MP3 format, and the ability to browse and create other rooms. The website initially used socket.io to power its multiplayer component before switching to WebSocket.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2015, a YouTube livestream showing off some of the site's features was hosted by Lockaby and his brother.
							</p>
							<h3>Squeezie's Visit</h3>
							<p>
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeITInLlww&?t=284">A YouTube video featuring Multiplayer Piano</a> was published in 2017 by popular French video creator Squeezie. The video resulted in a substantial increase in users on the website for several weeks.
							</p>
							<h3>Selling of Multiplayer Piano</h3>
							<p>
								On the 24th of October 2020, Lockaby sold Multiplayer Piano for USD $6500. The website was listed and sold via Flippa to a buyer under the alias of Jacored.</p>
							<p>	
								By 2021, plans to create a blog for Multiplayer Piano were underway. Users were invited to develop features and updates for the website, as well as write articles for the blog. Jacored implemented an advertisement banner provided by AdInPlay (since switched to Google AdSense). Advertisements had previously been present on the website, but were removed due a conflict

							As easily as someone can connect their piano to the website, they can also set up a program that can play pre-recorded MIDI files.
							MIDI files store all sorts of musical information about which notes to press and how to press them, and all you have to do get them started is press "Play" on a MIDI player program. 
						</p>
						<p>
							And so begins the problems...
