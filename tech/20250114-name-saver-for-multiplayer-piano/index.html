						<h3>Questions & Answers</h3>
						<b>Q: Why would I want this?</b>
						<p>A: You might not want your nickname to reset to 'Anonymous' or another name when you visit Multiplayer Piano. This script aims to fix that.</p>
						<b>Q: Doesn't my name already save?</b>
						<p>A: Sometimes. Here's why:<br></p>
						<ul>
							<li>You may land on an ID that you've previously used, where your nickname was set.</li>
							<li>
								However, this requires reloading multiple times to test IDs, which can be tedious.<br>
								This script handles this process automatically, ensuring your nickname is consistent.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Q: Didn't MPP used to save nicknames?</b>
						<p>A: Yes. Multiplayer Piano used to save consistent user IDs and nicknames, but this hasn't been working properly for a while.</p>
						<b>Q: Can't I just use another website?</b>
						<p>A: Yes. Multiplayer Piano isn't the only online piano available. This script was made for fun as a work-around for <a href="https://multiplayerpiano.com">multiplayerpiano.com</a> specifically. You can try alternatives like <a href="https://pianoverse.net">pianoverse.net</a>, <a href="https://multiplayerpiano.net">multiplayerpiano.net</a>, <a href="https://pianorhythm.io">pianorhythm.io</a> and many more.</p>
						<b>Q: How does this script work?</b>
						<p>A: The script saves your nickname in your browser's <b>localStorage</b> and sets it automatically every time you visit Multiplayer Piano. This ensures your nickname stays consistent across sessions on the same device.</p>
						<b>Q: Does this script sync my nickname across devices?</b>
						<p>A: No, the script uses <b>localStorage</b>, which is specific to the <b>browser</b> and <b>device</b> you're using. If you want the same nickname on another device, you'll need to set it there manually.</p>
						<b>Q: Is this safe to use?</b>
						<p>A: Yes, the script is open source and doesn't collect or send your data anywhere. It only runs in your browser to manage your nickname locally. Additionally, the script is released into the public domain, so you're free to use, modify, and share it without restrictions.</p>
						<b>Q: Why is there a bit.ly link?</b>
						<p>A: The bit.ly link is simply a short URL to make sharing easier. You can also use the direct link to the script on Greasyfork: <a href="https://greasyfork.org/scripts/522853">greasyfork.org/scripts/522853</a>.</p>
