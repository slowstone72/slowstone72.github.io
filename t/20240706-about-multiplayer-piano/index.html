					<h1>About Multiplayer Piano</h1>
					<section id="overview">
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>
							Multiplayer Piano (<a target="_blank" href="https://multiplayerpiano.com">multiplayerpiano.com</a>) is a website that allows users to share a piano with other users through the internet.
							It was published by its creator Brandon Lockaby as a <a target="_blank" href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/multiplayer-piano">Google Chrome Experiment</a> in 2012.
							Users can communicate through a text-based chat feature and record their performances.
						</p>
						<p>
							The website offers numerous ways to interact with the piano using a standard PC keyboard and mouse.
							For example, moving your cursor higher or lower on the page controls note velocity.
							Pressing Backspace on your keyboard will toggle a lengthy note sustain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Arguably, the most attractive feature offered to pianists is the ability to connect your own piano to the website - provided it's MIDI capable, something offered by most piano keyboards today.

							<h2>History</h2>
							<h3>Creation and Development</h3>
							<p>
								Multiplayer Piano was created and published by Brandon Lockaby in 2012 and offered a piano which could be played and heard by other users. Later on in development, numerous features were added including a text-based chat box, a [[Software synthesizer|synthesizer]], a sound selector, the ability to record in [[MP3]] format, and the ability to browse and create new rooms.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2015, a YouTube livestream showing off some of the site's features was hosted by Lockaby and his brother.
							</p>
							<h3>Squeezie's Visit</h3>
							<p>
								In 2017, Multiplayer Piano was featured alongside other Google Chrome Experiments in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeITInLlww&?t=284">YouTube video</a> published by popular French video creator Squeezie, resulting in an influx of French users on the website.
							</p>
							<h3>Sale of Multiplayer Piano</h3>
							<p>
								On the 24th of October 2020, Brandon Lockaby sold Multiplayer Piano for $6500 USD.</p>
							<p>	
								By 2021, plans to create a blog for Multiplayer Piano were underway. Users were invited to develop features and updates for the website, as well as write articles for the blog. Jacored implemented an advertisement banner provided by AdInPlay.

							As easily as someone can connect their piano to the website, they can also set up a program that can play pre-recorded MIDI files.
							MIDI files store all sorts of musical information about which notes to press and how to press them, and all you have to do get them started is press "Play" on a MIDI player program.
