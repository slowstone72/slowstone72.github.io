						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>
							Crystal FM was born out of my love for music across various eras, combined with a desire to share that music with others. It was a radio-like music bot for <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike most bots on Discord, which serve on-demand song requests, Crystal FM simply offered easy access to a steady stream of cherry-picked songs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The music Crystal FM played mostly consisted of pop & rock music released between the 1960s and 1990s. It was complemented by a wide range of unique instrumental tracks.
						</p>
						<p>
							These tracks could've been songs I'd heard in movies, on the radio, or anywhere else where music happened to be playing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Crystal FM was primarily used within a group of online friends who enjoyed listening to music together.

						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>
							At first, Crystal FM was called <b>Wave24R</b> (<b>Wave24 Radio</b>), with the 24 referencing its 24/7 operation. It was accompanied by the <b>Pre70sR (Pre-1970s Radio)</b> bot, which focused on older music that didn't mesh well with Wave24's 80s and 90s tunes. By separating the two services, I could maintain a more consistent listening experience for users.
						</p>
						<h3>Development</h3>
						<p>
							Crystal FM was written in JavaScript and ran with the server-side runtime environment <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.
						</p>
						<p>I hosted Crystal FM on a Dell OptiPlex 780 desktop computer for about a year from 2019, after which it was no longer practical to keep running.</p>
						<img src="a/w24rr2.png" style="float: right;" alt="'Wave24R (rewrite #2)'">
						<p>Three iterations of the code powering Crystal FM have been and gone:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<b>Wave24R Discord Bot</b>
									<p>
										This version of Wave24R is a modular Discord bot made to represent different "brands" of music bot (such as Crystal FM), built on the idea that I could easily swap out playlists and simply rebrand bots to fit different themes.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Wave24R Icecast Server</b>
									<p>
										This version of Wave24R was closer to a regular internet radio station. It created an audio livestream to broadcast the music to any client.
										This worked in parallel with a simple Discord bot I built to listen to the stream (amongst other internet radio stations) in any Discord voice channel.<br>
										To use it, you simply connected to a voice channel and sent a chat command specifying which station you wanted to listen to.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Crystal FM based on "S.A.F.E."</b>
									<p>
										This was the final rewrite of Crystal FM. It used a silly idea I came up with called "S.A.F.E." I can't really remember what the acronym stood for, but S.A.F.E. was my template launcher of sorts for a few of my future JavaScript programs and handled the configuration files, offered localization support and other repetitive tasks. It was my equivalent of a game engine for my JS programs. It didn't really stick.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

						<h2>Epilogue</h2>
						<p>If I were to revisit Crystal FM - or work on something similar - I would consider adding some of the features I had planned but never implemented.</p>
						<p>One idea was a song rating system which would lower or increase the probability of a song playing depending on how current listeners have rated it. This would serve as a sort of global voting system that tries compromises for all listeners in a given voice channel. Other ideas I had planned included the automatic handling of seasonal music during Halloween and Christmas periods.</p>
						<p>
							In the end, while I may be biased, I think Crystal FM was good while it lasted. Lots of great music was enjoyed using it, and I consider that a big success.
