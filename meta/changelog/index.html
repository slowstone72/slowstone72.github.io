			1. Start with the date on which changes were made.
			2. Prefix = for general changes (such as replacing an image, without removing the space in which it is shown).
			3. Prefix + for additions (such as new features or pages).
			4. Prefix - for removals (such as removal of unused images, sounds, or pages).
			5. Optionally, place any relevant images wherever deemed appropriate in the entry.
