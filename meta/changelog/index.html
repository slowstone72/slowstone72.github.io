			3. Prefix [+] for additions (such as new features or pages).
			4. Prefix [-] for removals (such as removal of unused images, sounds, or pages).
			5. Optionally, place any relevant images wherever deemed appropriate in the entry.

						<h2><u>22nd January 2025</u></h2>
						<ul>
							<li>[=] Added redirects to for certain queries on the 404 page.</li>
